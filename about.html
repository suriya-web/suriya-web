            E-WASTE
        </h1>
        <P><b>
            Introduction In India, the quantity of “e-waste” or electronic waste has now become a major problem. 
            Disposal of e-waste is an emerging global environmental and public health issue, 
            as this waste has become the most rapidly growing segment of the formal municipal waste stream in the world.
            (1) E-waste or Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) are loosely discarded, 
            surplus, obsolete, broken, electrical or electronic devices.
            (2) In India most of the waste electronic items are stored at households as people do not know how to discard them. 
            This ever-increasing waste is very complex in nature and is also a rich source of metals such as gold, 
            silver, and copper, which can be recovered and brought back into the production cycle. So e-waste trade and recycling alliances provide employment to many groups of people(3) in India. 
            Around 25,000 workers including children are involved in crude dismantling units in Delhi alone where 10,000–20,000 tonnes of e-waste is handled every year by bare hands. 
            Improper dismantling and processing of e-waste render it perilous to human health and our ecosystem. 
            Therefore, the need of proper e-waste management has been realized.
            (4) It is necessary to review the public health risks and strategies

                <h1>
                    Simple Ideas on How to Reduce E-waste
                </h1>
            
        <p><b>Technology has improved so rapidly in the past few decades that today it’s hard to imagine what the world would be like without smartphones,  GPS maps, laptops and other electronic devices.

            At the same time, the skyrocketing amount of used electronics being discarded has left environmental activists, state and local governments, and even the United Nations asking serious questions about how to reduce e-waste. There are now more mobile phones around the world than the number of people, and there are 7.5 billion people in the world. Reusing the precious metals and plastics in old cell phones instead of mining for brand new materials can save the energy equivalent to power up to 24,000 U.S. homes for a year, according to estimates by the Environmental Protection Agency.
            
            The obvious solution to this has been recycling, which takes the parts within electronics, even the broken ones, that still have value and makes them available for new products. But the recycling rates for e-waste remain stubbornly low, which is why proponents of recycling are doing what they can to educate people about the long-term environmental and economic benefits of the approach.
            
            There are actually very simple ways that all of us can help reduce e-waste, which is especially important at a time when our ever-growing reliance on electronics has led to e-waste becoming the largest growing waste stream worldwide.
            
            All it takes is a commitment from you to avoid either throwing away your used electronics or hoarding them in your closet or desk drawer.
            
            And the strategies for reducing e-waste should also include an awareness of your personal security: namely, making sure you delete all personal information from your electronic device so it doesn’t fall into the wrong hands.

        <P><b>
            Electronic equipments contain many hazardous metallic contaminants such as lead, cadmium, and beryllium and brominated flame-retardants [Table 1]. The fraction including iron, copper, aluminum, gold, and other metals in e-waste is over 60%, while plastics account for about 30% and the hazardous pollutants comprise only about 2.70%.(10) Of many toxic heavy metals, lead is the most widely used in electronic devices for various purposes, resulting in a variety of health hazards due to environmental contamination.(11) Lead enters biological systems via food, water, air, and soil. Children are particularly vulnerable to lead poisoning – more so than adults because they absorb more lead from their environment(12) and their nervous system and blood get affected. It is found that the e-waste recycling activities had contributed to the elevated blood lead levels in children living in China, which is one of the popular destinations of e-waste.(13) This was due to that fact that the processes and techniques used during the recycling activities were very primitive. Various studies have reported the soaring levels of toxic heavy metals and organic contaminants in samples of dust, soil, river sediment, surface water, and groundwater of Guiyu in China. In the same areas, the residents had a high incidence of skin damage, headaches, vertigo, nausea, chronic gastritis, and gastric and duodenal ulcers.(14) Further it was found that the blood lead levels of children were higher than the mean level in China, and there was no significant difference between boys and girls.(15)</P></b>
